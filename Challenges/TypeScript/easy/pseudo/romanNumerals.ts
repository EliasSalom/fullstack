Have the function BasicRomanNumerals(str) read str which will be a string of Roman numerals. 
The numerals being used are: I for 1, V for 5, X for 10, L for 50, C for 100, D for 500 and M for 1000. In Roman numerals, 
to create a number like 11 you simply add a 1 after the 10, so you get XI. But to create a number like 19, 
you use the subtraction notation which is to add an I before an X or V (or add an X before an L or C). So 19 in Roman numerals is XIX.

The goal of your program is to return the decimal equivalent of the Roman numeral given. For example: if str is "XXIV" your program should return 24

function basicRomanNumerals(str) {
    // 1. Declare an object with all the values for each roman letter.
    // 2. Declare a mutable result variable with an initial value of 0.
    // 3. Loop trough the string and declare a variable for the current item and the next item. (arr[i] && arr[i + 1])
    // 4. Check if the next value is greater than the current value, if  it does minus the current from the next and add the value to the result.
    // 5. Add 1 to the index to step off the next item. Else just add the current item value.
