Have the function AdditivePersistence(num) take the num parameter being passed which will always be a positive integer
and return its additive persistence which is the number of times you must add the digits in num until you reach a single digit.
For example: if num is 2718 then your program should return 2 because 2 + 7 + 1 + 8 = 18 and 1 + 8 = 9 and you stop at 9.

    // 1. Split the number into an array.
    // 2. Declare a recursion function with the following parameters => an array and a counter.
    /// 2.1 Set the counter to counter, if there is not a value set it to zero.
    /// 2.2 If the array length is less then 2,return the counter.
    /// 2.3 Else, reduce the array into one value and return the function itself with the array in splitted form and the counter plus 1.
    // 3. Return the recursion function.
