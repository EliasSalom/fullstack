Have the function LetterCountI(str) take the str parameter being passed and return the first word with the greatest number of repeated letters. 
For example: "Today, is the greatest day ever!" should return greatest because it has 2 e's (and 2 t's) and it comes before ever which also has 2 e's. 
If there are no words with repeating letters return -1. Words will be separated by spaces.

    /// 2.1 For each item add to the words object the item as a key and initial value of zero.

    // At this point we got 2 objects one with words that each of them got zero as a value. and letters object than contain the letters for each word and a counter as a value.
    // 3. Create and array from the values of the current word. then set the highest number as the value for the word key in the first object.

    /// 4.1 Set a variable for the current value for easy reading ( const value = object[key] )
    /// 4.2 If the current value is bigger than the biggest current num (The variable we declared at the start) set the biggest number as the current.
    /// 4.3 Pop out the '-1' value and push the current key to the relevant array.
    // 5. Return the first item in the biggest-array.
