Have the function MeanMode(arr) take the array of numbers stored in arr and return 1 if the mode equals the mean, 
0 if they don't equal each other (ie. [5, 3, 3, 3, 1] should return 1 because the mode (3) equals the mean (3)).
The array will not be empty, will only contain positive integers, and will not contain more than one mode.

    // 4. Loop trough the array and count for each value his appearance and set it in the hash table.
