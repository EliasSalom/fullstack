Have the function ProductDigits(num) take the num parameter being passed which will be a positive integer, 
and determine the least amount of digits you need to multiply to produce it. For example: if num is 24 then you can multiply 8 by 3 which produces 24, 
so your program should return 2 because there is a total of only 2 digits that are needed. Another example: if num is 90, you can multiply 10 * 9,
so in this case your program should output 3 because you cannot reach 90 without using a total of 3 digits in your multiplication.

function productDigits(num) {
    // 1. Declare first number variable as the current number from the input. (Set it as "let")
    // 2. Set a variable for results as an empty array.
    // 3. Declare a while loop that will run until the first num hit 1.
    /// 3.1 Set second num as the number from the input divided by the first number.
    /// 3.2 If the second number has no reminder do this => Take both first and second number as strings and collect their length, then push it to the array of results.
    /// 3.3 Minus by 1 the first number.
    // 4. From the result return the smallest number.
