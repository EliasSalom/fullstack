Have the function FizzBuzz(num) take the num parameter being passed and return all the numbers from 1 to num separated by spaces, 
but replace every number that is divisible by 3 with the word "Fizz", replace every number that is divisible by 5 with the word "Buzz", 
and every number that is divisible by both 3 and 5 with the word "FizzBuzz". For example: if num is 16, then your program should return the string 
"1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz 16". The input will be within the range 1 - 50.

function FizzBuzz(num: number) {
    // 1. Declare an array that will contain string and numbers.
    // 2. Loop trough the number + 1, start the index from 1.
    // 3. Declare a fizz condition. if the current number is dividable by 3.
    // 4. Declare a buzz condition. if the current number is dividable by 5.
    // 5. Declare a fizzBuzz condition. if both conditions are true.
    // 6. Do some if else statements and push to the array by the current condition.
